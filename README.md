# Clustering Algorithms

Examples of some of the Python assignments I completed at Johns Hopkins and Columbia University. Topics include:

- K-means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Mixture of Gaussians

Please reach out if I can help answer any questions about these topics or if I can help your organization employ similar tools.
